# BlastArena

A multiplayer online grid-based explosive arena game. Navigate a grid, place bombs to destroy walls and opponents, collect power-ups, and compete in Free-for-All, Teams, or Battle Royale modes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings (set JWT_SECRET and DB_PASSWORD)

# Development
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Production
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Game Modes

- **Free-for-All**: Last player standing wins
- **Teams**: Two teams compete; last team standing wins
- **Battle Royale**: Shrinking zone forces players together

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys / WASD**: Move
- **Space**: Place bomb
- **Walk into a bomb** (with Kick power-up): Kicks the bomb, sending it sliding until it hits a wall, player, or another bomb

## Features

- **Singleplayer & Multiplayer**: Play solo against bots or with friends; 1 human + bots is enough to start
- **Configurable rooms**: Map size (square grids from 11x11 to 31x31), match time, wall density, power-up types and drop rates
- **Friendly fire toggle**: Enable or disable teammate damage in Teams mode
- **Bot players**: Add up to 7 AI bots to any room (auto-capped to fit max players) with Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty
- **Bot AI**: BFS pathfinding, escape planning through danger zones, wall-seeking, enemy hunting, power-up collection
- **Power-ups**: Bomb Up, Fire Up, Speed Up, Shield, Bomb Kick - each individually toggleable per room
- **Live HUD**: Countdown timer, alive player list (dead players removed from view)
- **Spectator mode**: Dead players can freely pan the camera across the map
- **Camera follow**: Smooth scrolling camera that follows your player on maps larger than the viewport
- **Scoring**: Kills-based ranking; self-kills subtract from your score
- **Persistent sessions**: Login survives container rebuilds via httpOnly refresh token cookies
- **Match history**: Stats tracked per player (kills, deaths, bombs placed, power-ups collected, placements)
- **Game logging**: Detailed JSONL game logs for analysis and debugging (./data/gamelogs/)

- **Server-authoritative**: All game logic runs server-side at 20 ticks/sec. Clients send inputs and render state.
- **Grid-based movement**: Players occupy exactly one tile with movement cooldowns (speed power-ups reduce cooldown).
- **Monorepo**: npm workspaces with `shared/`, `backend/`, `frontend/` packages.
